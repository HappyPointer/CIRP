This is the code repo for MM'24 paper CIRP: Cross-Item Relational Pre-training for Multimodal Product Bundling


Todo (working on and should be coming up within a week):
1. Add codes for relation pruning - dataset augmentation.
2. Add codes for evaluating the pre-trained VLM.
3. Upload the training and evaluation datasets.
